## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
Following the planned milestones and issues helps us keep track of the project.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
Time management is challenging due to the workload of works outside of Codepath course.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?
We are on track but there are still many remaining features.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
We may work on CRUD for user profile to ensure to cover all required features first, then move to CRUD for clubs and events.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
We are working on authentication and still wait to learn about deployment the web app.
