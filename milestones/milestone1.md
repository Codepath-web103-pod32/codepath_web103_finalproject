## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

In our last class, we worked together to come up with ideas for our website. We wrote down our thoughts in a Google Doc and picked the best ones. We also made a schedule for when we would do each part of the project. This helped us finish on time.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

1. While Slack was convenient, it could be difficult to reach everyone at the same time, especially with different time zones and busy schedules, which sometimes led to delays or misunderstanding.
2. We have not learned about Authentication in the course so we can't estimate how much work is needed for this feature. Therefore, we cannot have a solid plan for all of features for the website (some more would be added after implementing Authentication).

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
